<h2>Referrals and Bonus':</h2>
<p>
    As you will be aware referrals are a way to secure newer business for companies. However, there is no reason 
    that we cannot make the most of these to help build a passive crypto balance. Please feel welcome to share 
    these links with others. Though I imagine after signing up you'll like want to share your own. Thanks for the support!
